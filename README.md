# Rust Web Example: *RESTful Axum*
##### Cole Nemec 2024.
>This is a repository for my work in Bart Massey's CS410P taught in Spring '24 at PSU.


# Development

Reference `main.rs` to identify the API routes. 

## Run the code once:
Invoke `cargo run` and visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser. 

## Re-run on source change:
After running `cargo install cargo-watch`, invoke `cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x run`.

I used Bart Massey's `knock-knock` project to design this draft of my question service. His code was referenced as I programmed my own material.

To better understand REST, I referenced the *What is a RESTful API* page from the AWS website ([here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/#:~:text=RESTful%20API%20is%20an%20interface,applications%20to%20perform%20various%20tasks.))
