# Rust Web Example: *RESTful Axum*
##### Cole Nemec 2024.
>This is repository for my work in Bart Massey's CS410P taught in Spring '24 at PSU.

## Run the code:
Compile `hello-world` from the base of the workspace with `cargo run --bin hello-world`. Then, visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.

The present code is based on programatik29's `axum-tutorial`[here](https://github.com/programatik29/axum-tutorial/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) which I'm following to familiarize myself with Axum, Tokio, and webdev with Rust. 
Right now, this repository is structured like a Rust workspace. Ultimately, it will be one cohesive project.
