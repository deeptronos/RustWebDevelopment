# Rust Web Example: *RESTful Axum*
##### Cole Nemec 2024.
>This is repository for my work in Bart Massey's CS410P taught in Spring '24 at PSU.

The present code is based on programatik29's `axum-tutorial`([here](https://github.com/programatik29/axum-tutorial/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)) which I'm following to familiarize myself with Axum, Tokio, and webdev with Rust. 

## Run the code:
Invoke `cargo run` and visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
 
## Sources:

I used Bart Massey's `Cargo.toml` file from his `knock-knock`project to design my list of dependencies in this `Cargo.toml`.

To better understand REST, I referenced the *What is a RESTful API* page from the AWS website ([here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/#:~:text=RESTful%20API%20is%20an%20interface,applications%20to%20perform%20various%20tasks.))
