# Rust Web Example: *RESTful Axum*
##### Cole Nemec 2024.
>This is repository for my work in Bart Massey's CS410P taught in Spring '24 at PSU.

The present code is based on programatik29's `axum-tutorial`[here](https://github.com/programatik29/axum-tutorial/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) which I'm following to familiarize myself with Axum, Tokio, and webdev with Rust. 

## Run the code:
Invoke `cargo run` and visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
